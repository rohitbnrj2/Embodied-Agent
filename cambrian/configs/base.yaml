# Not as easy as adding env@eval_env: ${env} to the defaults list because some required
# args are set in the downstream exp configs and these aren't carried over to eval_env
# when just loading the default env config. We use a utility function merge the config
# from downstream eval_env's into ${env} at instantiate rather than resolution. If we
# just set eval_env: ${env}, ${env} would resolve when these overrides are applied and
# any overrides of env in that config or downstream configs wouldn't be present in
# eval_env.
# NOTE: Instantiated configs are instantiated _before_ merge_with_kwargs is called.
# Therefore, we need to specify _recursive_: false so `config` isn't instantiated early.
# Then, in merge_with_kwargs, we instantiate the config.

# Contributing

Contributing to the repository is fairly easy, so please see below for instructions on how to actually make contributions to this project.

## Setup

There are two forms of contributions: source code or documentation. Editing the documentation is as simple as cloning the repo and adding/editing content within the `docs` folder. All documentation is written in `markdown` and converted to `html` through `myst_parser` and `sphinx`. To edit the source code, as well as the documentation, you will want to install the package [through a symlink](./setup.md#from-sources).

```{note}
A `conda` or `virtualenv` will add isolation to your python environments and reduce conflicts amongst packages. It is _highly_ recommended to use one!!
```

### Cloning the Repo

Clone the repo as normal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camera-culture/ACI.git && cd ACI
```

### Installing a Symbolic Linked Version for Testing

A symbolic link or symlink is a file that references another. The advantages of symlinks is that a folder or file can _essentially_ be placed in two separate locations. In reference to this repository, we want to create a symlinked install because when we edit the code within the cloned repo, we want that change also to be reflected in the installed files.

```bash
# You need the dev requirements to build the documentation
pip install poetry
poetry install --with dev
```

### Deploy your Changes

[GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are used to automatically build the site and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) are used to host the static site. To update deployed content, you have to push to the `main` branch. Once the changes are pushed, the site will rebuild. Please ensure there are no errors in your code/documentation before doing so, as you may get an email from github if something bad happens.

<!-- Further, to update the package available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ACI/), you must create a [git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). When a tag is created and pushed to GitHub, it will start an Action which will automatically push the new release to PyPI. See [Versioning](#versioning) for information on how versioning works with `ACI`. The Github Action only runs when the tag is pushed to main through a merge request. To create a tag, you may do the following: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- git tag <tag> # An example tag is v3.0.1 -->
<!-- git push origin main --tags -->
<!-- ``` -->

#### Versioning

Versioning is done automatically through `tags` by [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm). When a tag is pushed to the `main` branch, a new package is pushed to PyPI with the attached tag. Therefore, you must ensure the tag you push is _after_ the previous tags seen on GitHub (otherwise nothing will push to PyPI).

## Guidelines

A lot of work has gone into making this package functional and scalable. Please consider all of the following guidelines and follow them to ensure the repository will persist for a long time.

### File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
ACI/
├── cambrian/           # Source code
├── docs/               # Contains documentation
├── configs/            # Configuration files for experiments
├── models/             # Model files for MuJoCo
├── scripts/            # Scripts for running experiments
├── tools/              # Additional tooling for processing data
├── LICENSE
└── setup.py           # Package description and installation instructions for pip
```

### Editing the Source Code

If you plan on editing the source code, please visit the `cambrian/` folder. The `cambrian/` folder is structured as follows:

```
cambrian/
├── utils/              # Utility files for use by the rest of the package
│   └── ...
├── containers/         # Containers related utilities, methods, or classes
│   └── ...
├── agents/             # Agent related utilities, methods, or classes
│   └── ...
├── envs/               # Environment related utilities, methods, or classes
│   └── ...
├── eyes/               # Eye related utilities, methods, or classes
│   └── ...
├── ml/                 # Machine learning related utilities, methods, or classes
│   └── ...
├── renderer/           # Renderer related utilities, methods, or classes
│   └── ...
├── utils/              # Utility files for use by the rest of the package
│   └── ...
└── __init__.py         # Package initialization file
```

#### Commenting

Please follow [Google's guidelines for Python Styling](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). These comments are also used to automatically generate the documentation. For Visual Studio Code users, the [Python Docstring Generator](https://github.com/NilsJPWerner/autoDocstring) package may be helpful.

```{note}
Any docstrings parsed by `autosimple`, such as the functions in [usage.md](./usage/index.md), are parsed as markdown. Docstrings parsed by autoapi, such as in [cambrian.envs.MjCambrianEnv](./usage/api/cambrian/envs/env/index), are parsed as reStructuredText.
```

### Editing the Documentation

If you plan on editing the documentation pages (i.e. adding a tutorial or fixing an existing page), please visit the `docs/` folder. The `docs/` folder is structured as follows:

```
docs/
├── _static/            # Static files that persist through the build process
│   ├── css/custom.css  # Custom css changes that are different from the default furo theme
│   └── ...             # Images, favicons, etc.
├── usage/              # Usage reference guide for the ACI package
│   └── ...
├── setup.md            # Installation build instructions
├── contributing.md     # Contributing tab with instructions on how to contribute to the repo
├── conf.py             # Settings related to extensions, themes, etc.
└── index.md            # The "home" page
```

Please try to maintain the file structure as described above. All tabs with only a single page (i.e. background or contributing), should have their `markdown` file with in the `docs/` folder. If the tab has or will have multiple pages (i.e. a tutorials tab), create a folder titled the same as that tab. To add pages, insert the name of the file without the `.md` extension within the table of contents inside `index.md`. Each folder should also contain an `index.md` used as the home page of that tab.

Markdown files are converted to reStructuredText by `myst_parser` which is used by the documentation package [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Both Markdown and reStructuredText have their advantages and disadvantages, `myst_parser` allows us to use the easy to understand `markdown` language but also compile the content down to something Sphinx understands. To see additional features of the `myst_parser` library, please visit their [website](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Building the Documentation

There are multiple ways to build sphinx documentation. The easiest is using the `Makefile` or `make.bat` file provided directly in this repository. You will need to install all the necessary dependencies and build the html pages. To do that, run the following commands:

```bash
cd ACI
poetry install --with docs # Install the necessary dependencies

cd docs
make clean html
```

To view the build, go to your browser, and open the `index.html` file located inside `docs/build/html/`.

`sphinx-autobuild` is also extremely easy to use and will automatically build the html pages when a change is made. See their [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/). TL;DR: `pip install sphinx-autobuild` and run `sphinx-autobuild . build`.
